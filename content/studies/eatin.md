    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <div class="project__challenge-body">
        <p>
            Like Uber application model, we actually needed to develop two applications, one for eaters and one for cookers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Real-time communication between applications was essential.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start from zero. Having just an idea and some napkin sketches.
        </p>
        <p>
            Small team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zero codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
            No design.
        </p>

    <h3>Outcome &  Findings</h3>
    <div class="project__challenge-body">
        <p>
            To have a functional prototype as soon as possible was the most important task here. We need to be very clever in each decision we made.
            Experience is what gives you advantage in these situations, we can choose the right tool for each task, we already know what could work and what couldn't in the time range we had.
        </p>
        <p>
            Running tests by ourselves, compile and install the application everytime on our smartphones consume a lot of time. We decided to use automated actions cover that area, implementing a continuous integration and delivering was helpful to show progress and running integration test between apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Standing on the shoulders of giants." We opted to use PaaS/SaaS instead to waste time building everything from scratch like: Heroku, TestFlight, Github actions, Device Farm, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            I proposed to use figma as out designing tool, because is web based, collaborative and web/app design targeted. With Figma I created our design system that was perfectly translated to our component library with colors, themes, interactions, user flows, fonts, sizes, etc.
            I consider an advantage designing like a programmer, we tend to abstract the content the way we know will work, considering performance as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Collaborating in the back-end services as well as in both applications brings me absolutely autonomy to create entire user flow, from the registration to the creation of an order and upload of content. Having our custom-made CI/CD save us a lot of time on each version iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end we launch a functional prototype in 3-4 months of development. We were really happy with the result and the agile process we created.
